              We are various studios for the development and publication 
              of mobile applications, video games, web applications 
              and Design (2D, 3D, audio visual and animation).

              Here we are a team, and the studies contribute a large 
              part to complement the developments in the other projects, 
              in order to create applications that help everyone, 
              whether they are students, doctors, teachers, 
              people with disabilities and even the environment.
